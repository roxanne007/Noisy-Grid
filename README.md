# 🎨 Noisy Grid – Generative Art with p5.js

A browser-based generative art piece that creates a dynamic, "noisy" grid using randomness and/or Perlin noise.

## 🚀 Live Demo  
✨ [View the Noisy Grid](https://roxanne007.github.io/Noisy-Grid/)

## 🧠 Project Description
The sketch generates a grid of lines, shapes, or patterns where each cell is subtly influenced by noise or randomness. The result is a dynamic artwork that changes over time or with interaction.

Use this as a base for exploring creative coding, algorithmic art, and procedural design!

## 🎯 Features
- Animated grid with randomness or Perlin noise
- Clean visual output using canvas drawing
- Customisable grid size, spacing, and noise behaviour
- Built entirely in JavaScript with p5.js

## 🛠️ Built With
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- HTML / CSS / JS

## 📁 Folder Structure
Noisy-Grid/
├── index.html
├── sketch.js
├── style.css (if used)
└── libraries/
└── p5.min.js

## 💡 Possible Enhancements
- Add interactivity (mouse-controlled noise levels)
- Save snapshots as PNG
- Animate noise over time
- Colour palettes or theming
